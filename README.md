## Special Pythagorean Triplet
### Problem 9

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, $a < b < c$, for which, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

For example, $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2$.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which $a + b + c = 1000$. Find the product abc.


## Amicable Numbers
### Problem 21

Let $d(n)$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of $n$ (numbers less than $n$ which divide evenly into $n$.  If $d(a) = b$ and $d(b) = a$, where $a \ne b$, then $a$ and $b$ are an amicable pair and each of $a$ and $b$ are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of $220$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55$ and $110$; therefore $d(220) = 284$. The proper divisors of $284$ are $1, 2, 4, 71$ and $142$; so $d(284) = 220$.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under $10000$.
